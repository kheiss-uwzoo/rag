# Vision-Language Model (VLM) for Generation for NVIDIA RAG Blueprint

The Vision-Language Model (VLM) inference feature in the [NVIDIA RAG Blueprint](readme.md) enhances the system's ability to understand and reason about visual content. Unlike traditional image upload systems, this feature operates on image citations that are internally discovered during the retrieval process.

:::{note}
B200 GPUs are not supported for VLM based inferencing in RAG. For this feature, use H100 or A100 GPUs instead.
:::

**Key use cases for VLM**

- Documents with charts and graphs: Financial reports, scientific papers, business analytics
- Technical diagrams: Engineering schematics, architectural plans, flowcharts
- Visual data representations: Infographics, tables with visual elements, dashboards
- Mixed content documents: PDFs containing both text and images
- Image-heavy content: Catalogs, product documentation, visual guides

**Key benefits of VLM**

- **Seamless multimodal experience** – Users don't need to manually upload images; visual content is automatically discovered and analyzed from images embedded in documents.
- **Improved accuracy** – Enhanced response quality for documents containing images, charts, diagrams, and visual data.
- **Quality assurance** – Internal reasoning ensures only relevant visual insights are used.
- **Contextual understanding** – Visual analysis is performed in the context of the user's specific question.
- **Fallback handling** – System gracefully handles cases where images are insufficient or irrelevant.

:::{warning}
Enabling VLM inference increases response latency from additional image processing and VLM model inference time. Consider this trade-off between accuracy and speed based on your requirements.
:::

## How VLM Works in the RAG Pipeline

When VLM inference is enabled, the **VLM replaces the traditional LLM** in the RAG pipeline for generation tasks.

1. **Automatic Image Discovery**: When a user query is processed, the RAG system retrieves relevant documents from the vector database. If any of these documents contain images (charts, diagrams, photos, etc.), they are automatically identified.
2. **Image Captioning at Ingestion**: During ingestion, images are extracted and captioned so they can be indexed and later cited for question answering.
3. **VLM Answer Generation**: At query time, the RAG server sends the user question, conversation history, and cited images to a Vision-Language Model. The VLM directly generates the final answer for the user, taking the place of the traditional LLM.

**What users experience**: Users interact with the system normally—the VLM processing happens transparently:

1. User asks a question about content that may have visual elements.
2. System retrieves relevant documents including any images.
3. VLM analyzes images and text context if present and relevant.
4. User receives a single, coherent answer generated directly by the VLM.

## Prompt Customization

The VLM feature uses predefined prompts that can be customized in [`src/nvidia_rag/rag_server/prompt.yaml`](../src/nvidia_rag/rag_server/prompt.yaml) under the `vlm_template` section. The `vlm_template` controls how the question, textual context, and cited images are presented to the VLM.

**VLM reasoning vs. non-reasoning mode**: The VLM supports two modes controlled via the `vlm_template`:

- **Non-reasoning mode (default)**: Template path ends with `/no_think`. Default parameters: `APP_VLM_TEMPERATURE=0.1`, `APP_VLM_TOP_P=1.0`, `APP_VLM_MAX_TOKENS=8192`.
- **Reasoning mode (chain-of-thought)**: Change the route in `vlm_template` from `/no_think` to `/think`. Recommended: `APP_VLM_TEMPERATURE=0.3`, `APP_VLM_TOP_P=0.91`, `APP_VLM_MAX_TOKENS=8192`.

Set these parameters via environment variables in your deployment configuration (for example in `docker-compose-rag-server.yaml` or Helm `values.yaml`).

## Enable VLM with Docker Compose

NVIDIA RAG uses the [**nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl**](https://build.nvidia.com/nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl) Vision-Language Model by default, provided as the `vlm-ms` service in `deploy/compose/nims.yaml`.

The `vlm-generation` profile in `deploy/compose/nims.yaml` is designed for VLM-based generation on **2xH100 GPUs**. It skips the NIM LLM deployment (VLM replaces LLM), deploys the VLM service (`vlm-ms`), and deploys embedding and reranker microservices.

**GPU allocation for 2xH100**: GPU 0 for Embedding and Reranker; GPU 1 for VLM (replaces LLM). You must set `VLM_MS_GPU_ID=1`.

1. Set the VLM GPU assignment and start VLM and supporting services (skips nim-llm):

   ```bash
   export VLM_MS_GPU_ID=1
   USERID=$(id -u) docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml --profile vlm-generation up -d
   ```

   :::{warning}
   Only change `VLM_MS_GPU_ID` for systems with 3+ GPUs.
   :::

   For systems with 3+ GPUs, you can assign VLM to a different GPU (for example, GPU 3):

   ```bash
   export VLM_MS_GPU_ID=3
   USERID=$(id -u) docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml --profile vlm-generation up -d
   ```

2. Enable image extraction and captioning for ingestion. In `deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml`, under the `ingestor-server` service, ensure `APP_NVINGEST_EXTRACTIMAGES` is set to `True` so images are extracted and stored. Image captioning is enabled by default: `APP_NVINGEST_CAPTIONMODELNAME` is set to `nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl` and `APP_NVINGEST_CAPTIONENDPOINTURL` points to the `vlm-ms` service. Override via environment variables if needed:

   ```bash
   export APP_NVINGEST_EXTRACTIMAGES=True
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml up -d
   ```

3. Configure the RAG server to use VLM. Set the following environment variables in [docker-compose-rag-server.yaml](../deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml), then restart the rag-server:

   ```bash
   export ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE="true"
   export APP_VLM_MODELNAME="nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
   export APP_VLM_SERVERURL="http://vlm-ms:8000/v1"
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
   ```

   - `ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE`: Enables VLM inference in the RAG server.
   - `APP_VLM_MODELNAME`: The name of the VLM model to use.
   - `APP_VLM_SERVERURL`: The URL of the VLM NIM server (local or remote).

   :::{note}
   When using the `vlm-generation` profile, there is no LLM service running. The VLM handles all generation tasks. Optional fallback is controlled by `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK` (see [VLM to LLM Fallback](#vlm-to-llm-fallback-optional)).
   :::

4. Continue with the rest of the steps in [Deploy with Docker (Self-Hosted Models)](deploy-docker-self-hosted.md) to deploy the ingestion-server and rag-server containers.

### Using a Remote NVIDIA-Hosted NIM (Optional)

To use a remote NVIDIA-hosted NIM for VLM inference, set `APP_VLM_SERVERURL` to the remote endpoint:

```bash
export ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE="true"
export APP_VLM_MODELNAME="nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
export APP_VLM_SERVERURL="https://integrate.api.nvidia.com/v1/"
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
```

Continue with [Deploy with Docker (NVIDIA-Hosted Models)](deploy-docker-nvidia-hosted.md) as needed.

## Enable VLM with Helm

:::{note}
**GPU requirements for Helm**: VLM uses the same GPU normally assigned to LLM (GPU 1). With MIG slicing, assign a dedicated MIG slice to the VLM—see [mig-deployment.md](mig-deployment.md) and [values-mig-h100.yaml](../deploy/helm/mig-slicing/values-mig-h100.yaml) or [values-mig-rtx6000.yaml](../deploy/helm/mig-slicing/values-mig-rtx6000.yaml). To run both VLM and LLM simultaneously, an additional GPU is required.
:::

1. In [values.yaml](../deploy/helm/nvidia-blueprint-rag/values.yaml), under the `rag-server` `envVars` section, set:

   ```yaml
   ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE: "true"
   APP_VLM_MODELNAME: "nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
   APP_VLM_SERVERURL: "http://nim-vlm:8000/v1"
   ```

2. Enable `nim-vlm` and disable `nim-llm` (VLM replaces LLM for generation):

   ```yaml
   nimOperator:
     nim-vlm:
       enabled: true
     nim-llm:
       enabled: false
   ```

   :::{important}
   By disabling `nim-llm` and enabling `nim-vlm`, the VLM uses the GPU resources normally allocated to the LLM, so no additional hardware is required.
   :::

3. Apply the changes as described in [Change a Deployment](deploy-helm.md#change-a-deployment). For full steps, see [Deploy with Helm](deploy-helm.md).

4. Verify the VLM pod is running. A pod with the name `nim-vlm-*` will start (the `nim-llm` pod will not be created when it is disabled). Example status:

   ```text
   rag       nim-vlm-f4c446cbf-ffzm7       1/1     Running   0          22m
   ```

:::{note}
**Service architecture**: With VLM enabled and LLM disabled, the RAG pipeline uses VLM for all generation tasks. The embedding and reranking services remain active for document retrieval. For local VLM inference, ensure the VLM NIM service is running and accessible at the configured `APP_VLM_SERVERURL`. For remote endpoints, the `NGC_API_KEY` is required for authentication.
:::

## Configuration

- **Image limits**: `APP_VLM_MAX_TOTAL_IMAGES` (default: 5) is the maximum total images (from query, history, and context) included in the VLM prompt. Set via environment variables and restart the rag-server to apply.

   Example (Docker Compose):

   ```bash
   export ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE="true"
   export APP_VLM_MAX_TOTAL_IMAGES="5"
   docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
   ```

- **Context limitations**: The VLM receives the current user query, a truncated conversation history, and a textual summary of retrieved documents, together with any cited images. The effective context window of the VLM is limited, so very long conversations or large document contexts may be truncated.

   :::{warning}
   Keep user questions as self-contained as possible, especially in long-running conversations. Use retrieval and prompt tuning to focus the most relevant context for the VLM.
   :::

## VLM to LLM Fallback (Optional)

By default, with VLM enabled, the RAG server uses VLM for all generation tasks. The `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK` environment variable controls behavior for text-only queries (no images in query, messages, or retrieved context).

- **Default (no fallback)**: `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK="false"`. The VLM handles all queries. Recommended for the 2xH100 setup.
- **Enable fallback**: `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK="true"`. Text-only queries use a traditional LLM. You must deploy an LLM service alongside the VLM.

**GPU requirements for fallback**: Minimum **3xH100 GPUs**—GPU 0: Embedding and Reranker; GPU 1: VLM; GPU 2: LLM.

**Docker Compose with fallback**: Start both VLM and LLM (do not use the `vlm-generation` profile):

```bash
export VLM_MS_GPU_ID=1
export LLM_MS_GPU_ID=2
USERID=$(id -u) docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml up -d

export ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE="true"
export VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK="true"
export APP_VLM_MODELNAME="nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
export APP_VLM_SERVERURL="http://vlm-ms:8000/v1"
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
```

:::{warning}
Do not use the `vlm-generation` profile when fallback is enabled; it skips the LLM. Using `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK="true"` with that profile will cause errors for text-only queries.
:::

**Helm with fallback**: In `values.yaml`, set `VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK: "true"` and keep both `nim-vlm` and `nim-llm` enabled:

```yaml
envVars:
  ENABLE_VLM_INFERENCE: "true"
  VLM_TO_LLM_FALLBACK: "true"
  APP_VLM_MODELNAME: "nvidia/nemotron-nano-12b-v2-vl"
  APP_VLM_SERVERURL: "http://nim-vlm:8000/v1"

nimOperator:
  nim-vlm:
    enabled: true
  nim-llm:
    enabled: true
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the VLM NIM is running and reachable at the configured `APP_VLM_SERVERURL`.
- For remote endpoints, ensure `NGC_API_KEY` is valid and has access to the model.
- Check rag-server logs for VLM inference or API authentication errors.
- Verify that images are ingested, captioned, and indexed in your knowledge base.

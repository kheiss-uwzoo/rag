# RAG Claw — OpenClaw Plugin

NVIDIA RAG Blueprint agent for [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw). Provides skills covering the full RAG lifecycle: prerequisites and deployment, configuration, troubleshooting, RAGAS evaluation, and performance benchmarking.

---

## Prerequisites

### OpenClaw host

| Requirement | Notes |
|-------------|-------|
| **Node.js** | **≥ 22.19.0** (required by OpenClaw and this plugin). System Node 20/21 is not supported. |
| **npm** | Bundled with Node; used for global OpenClaw CLI and local plugin build. |
| **nvm** (recommended) | Installs Node in your home directory so `npm install -g` works without `sudo`. |

Install Node 22 with [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), then use it in every shell:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.40.3/install.sh | bash
source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 22
nvm alias default 22
node -v   # v22.x.x
```

### RAG deployment

The following should be in place before deploying RAG containers. The agent checks and guides you through each step via the `rag-blueprint` skill — this is a quick reference.

| Requirement | Notes | Install guide |
|-------------|-------|---------------|
| NVIDIA GPU driver | See `docs/support-matrix.md` for minimum version | [nvidia.com/drivers](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/drivers/) — reboot after install |
| Docker Engine | Required for Docker Compose deployments | [docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) |
| Docker Compose | v2.x | Included with Docker Desktop / Engine |
| NVIDIA Container Toolkit | Required for self-hosted NIMs | [Container Toolkit install guide](https://docs.nvidia.com/datacenter/cloud-native/container-toolkit/latest/install-guide.html) |
| NGC API key | `NGC_API_KEY` or `NVIDIA_API_KEY` | [org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys](https://org.ngc.nvidia.com/setup/api-keys) |

**Post-Docker install:** add your user to the docker group so containers run without sudo:

```bash
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER && newgrp docker
```

---

## 1. Install OpenClaw

Use the nvm Node 22 shell (see above), then install the CLI globally:

```bash
npm install -g openclaw
openclaw --version
```

Run guided setup once (models, API keys, workspace, gateway):

```bash
openclaw onboard
```

For NVIDIA API Catalog models, you can pass `--auth-choice nvidia-api-key` during onboard, or set `NVIDIA_API_KEY` / `NGC_API_KEY` in your environment and configure later with `openclaw configure`.

---

## 2. Install the RAG Claw Plugin

OpenClaw loads **compiled** JavaScript from `dist/`. Build the plugin from the RAG repo, then install with **`--link`** so OpenClaw uses your checkout in place (recommended for development and for machines where a copy install fails peer-dependency linking).

**From the cloned RAG repo:**

```bash
cd /path/to/rag/.openclaw
npm install
npm run build
openclaw plugins install --link /path/to/rag/.openclaw/
```

Use an **absolute path** to `.openclaw/` (as above). `npm run build` compiles `index.ts` → `dist/index.js` and copies skills from `skill-source/.agents/skills/` into `skills/`.

Do **not** use a bare copy install (`openclaw plugins install /path/to/rag/.openclaw/` or `openclaw plugins install ./` from inside `.openclaw/`) unless you are using a packaged OpenClaw install that can symlink the `openclaw` peer dependency. On many systems that fails with:

```text
Installed plugin openclaw-rag declares openclaw as a peer dependency, but OpenClaw could not create a plugin-local node_modules/openclaw link.
```

`@nvidia/openclaw-rag` is **not published to npm** yet. Do not run `openclaw plugins install @nvidia/openclaw-rag` until the package is available on the registry.

Restart the gateway after install so the plugin loads:

```bash
# foreground gateway: stop and run again
openclaw gateway run

# or systemd user service
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway
```

On first gateway start, the plugin copies workspace templates (`BOOTSTRAP.md`, `IDENTITY.md`, `SOUL.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `TOOLS.md`) to `~/.openclaw/workspace/`. If Docker is present, it may write a systemd drop-in for gateway Docker socket access — apply it with:

```bash
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart openclaw-gateway
```

---

## 3. Verify

```bash
openclaw skills list | grep -E "rag-blueprint|rag-eval|rag-perf"
```

Expected output:

```text
rag-blueprint  Deploy, configure, troubleshoot, and manage the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint
rag-eval       Filesystem RAG benchmarks (corpus/, train.json, RAGAS via evaluate_rag.py)
rag-perf       Performance benchmarking (aiperf load tests) for a deployed RAG server
```

---

## 4. Run and interact

Start the **gateway** (required for chat and the web UI):

```bash
# foreground (good for first try)
openclaw gateway run

# or install and start a user service
openclaw gateway install
systemctl --user start openclaw-gateway
```

Add a long agent timeout for RAG deploys and evals (merge into `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`):

```json
{
  "agents": {
    "defaults": {
      "timeoutSeconds": 3600
    }
  }
}
```

In another terminal, use any of these:

| Interface | Command |
|-----------|---------|
| Terminal chat (gateway) | `openclaw tui --timeout-ms 3600000` |
| Terminal chat (local) | `openclaw chat --timeout-ms 3600000` |
| Web Control UI | `openclaw dashboard` → `http://127.0.0.1:18789/` |
| One-shot turn | `openclaw agent --message "check prerequisites"` |

Prefer **gateway-backed** `openclaw tui` (not `openclaw chat`) for end-to-end RAG Docker deploys: the gateway keeps the run alive while the terminal UI may show `idle` after ~30s without streamed text. If you see _"This response is taking longer than expected"_, wait for the run to finish or send a short follow-up (for example _"status update"_); avoid starting a new deploy request until the prior turn completes. Inside the TUI, `/verbose full` shows tool progress during long shell work.

Check status:

```bash
openclaw status
openclaw health
```

**First session:** start `openclaw tui` (with the gateway running). The BOOTSTRAP flow runs automatically and the agent introduces itself and walks through initial RAG configuration.

Example prompts:

- _"check prerequisites"_
- _"deploy RAG with NVIDIA-hosted NIMs"_
- _"RAG server is unhealthy"_
- _"run RAGAS eval on my benchmark dataset"_

Optional: install the browser skill into the workspace (used for RAG UI automation):

```bash
cd ~/.openclaw/workspace
npx --yes skills add vercel-labs/agent-browser --yes
```

## Troubleshooting plugin install

| Error | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| `could not create a plugin-local node_modules/openclaw link` | Copy install (`plugins install` without `--link`) | `openclaw plugins install --link /path/to/rag/.openclaw/` after `npm run build` |
| `Package not found on npm: @nvidia/openclaw-rag` | Package not published | Install from the repo with `--link` (see above) |
| `package.json missing openclaw.hooks` | OpenClaw also tried hook-pack install | Ignore if the native plugin install succeeded; use `--link` on the `.openclaw/` directory |
| Skills missing after install | `dist/` or `skills/` not built | `cd /path/to/rag/.openclaw && npm install && npm run build`, then reinstall with `--link` |

OpenClaw plugin install reference: [docs.openclaw.ai/tools/plugin](https://docs.openclaw.ai/tools/plugin) (local checkouts: `openclaw plugins install --link ./my-plugin`).

# AGENTS.md - Your Workspace

This folder is home. Treat it that way.

## First Run

If `BOOTSTRAP.md` exists, that's your birth certificate. Follow it, figure out who you are, then delete it. You won't need it again.

## Every Session

Before doing anything else:

1. Read `SOUL.md` — this is who you are
2. Read `USER.md` — this is who you're helping
3. Read `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (today + yesterday) for recent context
4. **If in MAIN SESSION** (direct chat with your human): Also read `MEMORY.md`

Don't ask permission. Just do it.

## Memory

You wake up fresh each session. These files are your continuity:

- **Daily notes:** `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` (create `memory/` if needed) — raw logs of what happened
- **Long-term:** `MEMORY.md` — your curated memories, like a human's long-term memory

Capture what matters. Decisions, context, things to remember. Skip the secrets unless asked to keep them.

### MEMORY.md - Your Long-Term Memory

- **ONLY load in main session** (direct chats with your human)
- **DO NOT load in shared contexts** (Discord, group chats, sessions with other people)
- You can **read, edit, and update** MEMORY.md freely in main sessions

### Write It Down - No "Mental Notes"!

- **Memory is limited** — if you want to remember something, WRITE IT TO A FILE
- When someone says "remember this" → update `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` or relevant file
- When you learn a lesson → update AGENTS.md, TOOLS.md, or the relevant skill

## Safety

- Don't exfiltrate private data. Ever.
- Don't run destructive commands without asking.
- `trash` > `rm` (recoverable beats gone forever)
- When in doubt, ask.

## External vs Internal

**Safe to do freely:** read files, explore, organize, learn, search the web, work within this workspace.

**Ask first:** sending emails, public posts, anything that leaves the machine, anything you're uncertain about.

## Tools

Skills provide your tools. When you need one, check its `SKILL.md`. Keep local notes (repo path, deployment mode, ports) in `TOOLS.md`.

### RAG skills routing

| User intent | Skill |
|-------------|-------|
| Deploy, configure, troubleshoot, shutdown | `rag-blueprint` |
| RAGAS eval, `corpus/` + `train.json`, `evaluate_rag.py` | `rag-eval` |
| aiperf, latency, throughput benchmarking | `rag-perf` |

Always read the skill's `SKILL.md` and referenced playbooks before changing deployment config.

### RAG API conventions

> **You have `curl` and shell access. For RAG and ingestor API calls — run them yourself. Do NOT tell the user to run curl in their terminal unless they must supply a secret interactively.**

Default endpoints (see `TOOLS.md` for overrides):

| Service | Base URL |
|---------|----------|
| RAG server | `http://localhost:8081` |
| Ingestor | `http://localhost:8082` (no `/v1` prefix on ingestor base URL) |

Health check:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8081/v1/health?check_dependencies=true" | head -c 500
```

OpenAPI schemas live under `docs/api_reference/` in the repo.

### RAG UI (agent-browser)

> **When the user asks you to use the RAG web UI — do it yourself with `agent-browser`. Do NOT give click-by-click instructions.**

- RAG frontend default: **http://localhost:8090**
- Snapshot first, then interact:

```bash
npx agent-browser --auto-connect snapshot -i
npx agent-browser --auto-connect click @e5
```

### RAG deploy conventions

> **During long Docker pulls or compose bring-up, post brief progress updates in chat every ~20s** (for example: which compose file is starting, `docker ps` summary). This keeps the OpenClaw terminal UI from appearing stuck while tools run.
> **You have Docker access. Run deploy and docker compose commands yourself — do NOT ask the user to run them unless they must provide a secret.**
> **API keys for NVIDIA-hosted deploys:** read from `deploy/compose/nvdev.env` in the RAG repo (`NGC_API_KEY` / `NVIDIA_API_KEY`). Source that file before compose; do not ask the user to paste keys unless the file is missing.

- **Repo path:** read from `TOOLS.md` RAG section.
- **Config source of truth:** `deploy/compose/.env` (self-hosted) or `deploy/compose/nvdev.env` (NVIDIA-hosted). Shell-only exports are lost on container restart — edit the env file.
- **Before deploy:** ensure `NGC_API_KEY` or `NVIDIA_API_KEY` is set; never print the key.
- **Deploy workflow:** use `rag-blueprint` → `references/deploy.md` and the routed playbook (`deploy/docker.md`, `deploy/helm.md`, or `deploy/library.md`).
- **Typical Docker bring-up** (from repo root, after env is configured):

```bash
cd <repo>
set -a && source deploy/compose/<env-file> && set +a
docker compose -f deploy/compose/vectordb.yaml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/nims.yaml up -d          # self-hosted only
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-ingestor-server.yaml up -d
docker compose -f deploy/compose/docker-compose-rag-server.yaml up -d
```

Exact compose files and order depend on deployment mode — follow the skill playbook, not this snippet alone.

- **Long pulls / starts:** run in background with `nohup` and poll `docker ps` and service logs; report progress without blocking the conversation.
- **After changes:** verify with health check and `docker ps --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'`.

### RAG evaluation conventions

- Run eval commands **from repo root**.
- Install eval deps: `uv sync --project scripts/eval`
- Export `NVIDIA_API_KEY` for RAGAS; use `rag-eval` skill for dataset layout and CLI flags.
- Ingestor URL for eval must **not** include `/v1` on the base host:port.

### Platform formatting

- **Discord/WhatsApp:** No markdown tables — use bullet lists
- **Discord links:** Wrap multiple links in `<>` to suppress embeds

## Heartbeats

When you receive a heartbeat poll, read `HEARTBEAT.md` if it exists. If nothing needs attention, reply `HEARTBEAT_OK`.

## Make It Yours

Add your own conventions as you learn what works for this deployment.

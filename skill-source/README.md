# RAG Blueprint Agent Skills

Agent skills that enable AI coding assistants (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, etc.) to operate, evaluate, and benchmark the NVIDIA RAG Blueprint.

## Installation

```bash
npx skills add .
```

Select the skill that matches the task:

- **rag-blueprint** — deploy, configure, shutdown, troubleshoot, and manage RAG services.
- **rag-eval** — filesystem RAGAS-style quality benchmarks with `scripts/eval/evaluate_rag.py`.
- **rag-perf** — config-driven performance benchmarks with `scripts/rag-perf`.

## Architecture: Skills = Process, Docs = Truth

```
SKILL.md           = ROUTER (intent detection, autonomy rules, configure routing table)
Reference files    = WHAT/HOW (deployment workflows, feature playbooks, diagnostics)
docs/*.md          = SOURCE OF TRUTH (never copied into skills)
notebooks/*.ipynb  = RUNNABLE EXAMPLES (referenced from relevant skills)
```

The SKILL.md detects user intent and routes to the correct reference file. Reference files are concise playbooks that point to `docs/*.md` for detailed configuration — this prevents staleness from duplicated content.

## How It Works

1. User says "deploy RAG" → SKILL.md routes to `references/deploy.md` → env analysis → routes to `deploy/docker.md`, `deploy/helm.md`, or `deploy/library.md`
2. User says "enable VLM" → SKILL.md routes to `references/configure/vlm.md` → reads `docs/vlm.md` for detailed steps
3. User says "RAG is broken" → SKILL.md routes to `references/troubleshoot.md` → auto-triage diagnostic sweep
4. User says "stop RAG" → SKILL.md routes to `references/shutdown.md` → detects and stops all services

## Supported Deployment Modes

Read `docs/support-matrix.md` for current hardware requirements per mode.

| Mode | Docker Required | Description |
|------|-----------------|-------------|
| Docker (self-hosted) | Yes | Full on-prem with local NIM inference |
| Docker (NVIDIA-hosted) | Yes | Cloud APIs for model inference |
| Docker (retrieval-only) | Yes | No LLM, search/retrieve only |
| Helm / Kubernetes | No (K8s) | Production K8s with NIM Operator |
| Library (full) | Yes (backend) | Python API with Docker backend services |
| Library (lite) | No | Milvus Lite + cloud APIs, zero infrastructure |

## OpenClaw (RAG Claw plugin)

To use these skills with [OpenClaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw), build and link the plugin from the RAG repo (use an absolute path):

```bash
cd /path/to/rag/.openclaw && npm install && npm run build
openclaw plugins install --link /path/to/rag/.openclaw/
```

See [`.openclaw/README.md`](../.openclaw/README.md) for prerequisites, verification, troubleshooting, and trigger phrases.

## NGC_API_KEY Handling

Skills never expose the API key value to the LLM. The approach:

1. Check if `NGC_API_KEY` is set: `[ -n "$NGC_API_KEY" ] && echo "SET" || echo "NOT_SET"`
2. If not set, ask the user to run `export NGC_API_KEY="nvapi-your-key"` in the terminal
3. For `docker login`, the user runs it themselves (the command expands the key)
4. As a fallback, offer to write a placeholder to `deploy/compose/.env` for the user to replace
